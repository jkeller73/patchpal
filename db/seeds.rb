# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


  # puts "Cleaning database..."
  # Plant.destroy_all

  # puts "Creating plants..."
  # plant1 = Plant.create(name: "Potato", description: "potato des.", hardiness: "hard", position_in: "sun", sowing: "summer", more_info: "more info ")
  # plant2 = Plant.create(name: "Leek", description: "leed des.", hardiness: "not hard", position_in: "not sun", sowing: "summer", more_info: "more info 2")

  # puts "Finished!"
